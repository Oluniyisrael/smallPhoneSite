        <span class="lyrics">
            Love all your ways
            Love all your flaws
            Love all your moments when you don't know who you are
            Love when you're lost tryna follow stars
            Love with all you got, even on days when loving you is hard, yeah
            Love you with all your scars and your heartache
            Love you and all those times that you lost your mind
            Love you on those "I don't know where to start" days
            Even though on days like that its always hard to find
            Hey, love you and your soul
            Don't ever forget to love you when they don't, ohh
            Baby you should know
            Never let that love for you go <br/><br/>
            Cause its dangerous to let somebody love you more than you love yourself
            (More than you love, yeah)
            So don't you let nobody love you more than you love yourself
            (More than you love)
            When you go through changes
            Hope you love you the same way
            Love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah
            Mmm mmm
            Cause everyone's changing
            We're the same in that way, yeah
            So love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah
            Mmm mmm mmm<br/><br/>
            Maybe you maybe you never knew
            You could be that someone who's been treating you better and
            There's always something that you could lose
            But baby you could be the one that's leaving you never
            And the truth
            Is you got all this love inside of you
            Don't worry about someone else's views
            When they see how you carry on through
            They'll carry on too, yeah
            Don't forget
            Its dangerous to let somebody love you (More than you love yourself, ooh yeah)
            So don't you go let nobody love you (More than you love yourself, ooh yeah)
            When you go through changes
            Hope you love you the same way
            Love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah
            Mmm mmm
            Cause everyone's changing
            We're the same in that way, yeah
            So love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah
            Mmm mmm mmm
