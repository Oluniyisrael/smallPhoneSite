            [Verse] <br/>
            <em>Love all your ways</em>,<br/><br/>
            Love all your flaws,<br/><br/>
            Love all your moments when you don't know who you are,<br/><br/>
            Love when you're lost tryna follow stars,<br/><br/>
            Love with all you got, even on days when loving you is hard, yeah,<br/><br/>
            Love you with all your scars and your heartache,<br/><br/>
            Love you and all those times that you lost your mind,<br/><br/>
            Love you on those "I don't know where to start" days,<br/><br/>
            Even though on days like that its always hard to find,<br/><br/>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br/>
            Hey, love you and your soul,<br/><br/>
            Don't ever forget to love you when they don't, ohh,<br/><br/>
            Baby you should know,<br/><br/>
            Never let that love for you go <br/><br/><br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Cause its dangerous to let somebody love you more than you love yourself,<br/><br/>
            (More than you love, yeah),<br/><br/>
            So don't you let nobody love you more than you love yourself,<br/><br/>
            (More than you love),<br/><br/>
            When you go through changes,<br/><br/>
            Hope you love you the same way,<br/><br/>
            Love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah,<br/><br/>
            Mmm mmm,<br/><br/>
            Cause everyone's changing,<br/><br/>
            We're the same in that way, yeah,<br/><br/>
            So love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah,<br/><br/>
            Mmm mmm mmm<br/><br/><br/>
            [Verse] <br/>
            Maybe you maybe you never knew,<br/><br/>
            You could be that someone who's been treating you better and,<br/><br/>
            There's always something that you could lose,<br/><br/>
            But baby you could be the one that's leaving you never,<br/><br/>
            And the truth,<br/><br/>
            Is you got all this love inside of you,<br/><br/>
            Don't worry about someone else's views,<br/><br/>
            When they see how you carry on through,<br/><br/>
            They'll carry on too, yeah,<br/><br/>
            Don't forget,<br/><br/>
            [Chorus] <br/>
            Its dangerous to let somebody love you (More than you love yourself, ooh yeah),<br/><br/>
            So don't you go let nobody love you (More than you love yourself, ooh yeah),<br/><br/>
            When you go through changes,<br/><br/>
            Hope you love you the same way,<br/><br/>
            Love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah,<br/><br/>,<br/><br/>
            Mmm mmm,<br/><br/>
            Cause everyone's changing,<br/><br/>
            We're the same in that way, yeah,<br/><br/>
            So love yesterday, everyday, love yourself always, yeah,<br/><br/>
            Mmm mmm mmm<br/><br/>
