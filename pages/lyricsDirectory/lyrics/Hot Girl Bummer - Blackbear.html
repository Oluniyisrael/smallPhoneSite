            [Intro]<br/> 
            Fuck you, and you, and you<br/><br/>
            I hate your friends and they hate me too<br/><br/>
            I'm through, I'm through, I'm through<br/><br/>
            This that hot girl bummer anthem<br/><br/>
            Turn it up and throw a tantrum<br/><br/>
            
            [Verse 1]<br/> 
            This that hot girl bummer anthem<br/><br/>
            Turn it up and throw a tantrum<br/><br/>
            This that throw up in your Birkin bag<br/><br/>
            Hook up with someone random<br/><br/>
            This that social awkward suicide<br/><br/>
            That buy your lips and buy your likes<br/><br/>
            I swear she had a man<br/><br/>
            But shit hit different when it's Thursday night<br/><br/>
            
            
            [Pre-Chorus]<br/> 
            That college dropout music<br/><br/>
            Every day leg day, she be too thick<br/><br/>
            And my friends are all annoying<br/><br/>
            But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid<br/><br/>
            This that 10K on the table<br/><br/>
            Just so we can be secluded<br/><br/>
            And the vodka came diluted<br/><br/>
            One more line, I'm superhuman<br/><br/>
            
            [Chorus]<br/>
            Fuck you, and you, and you<br/><br/>
            I hate your friends and they hate me too<br/><br/>
            I'm through, I'm through, I'm through<br/><br/>
            This that hot girl bummer anthem<br/><br/>
            Turn it up and throw a tantrum<br/><br/>
            Fuck you, and you, and you<br/><br/>
            I hate your friends and they hate me too<br/><br/>
            Fuck you, and you, and you<br/><br/>
            This that hot girl bummer anthem<br/><br/>
            Turn it up and throw a tantrum<br/><br/>
            
            [Verse 2]<br/>
            This that hot girl bummer two-step<br/><br/>
            They can't box me in, I'm too left<br/><br/>
            This that drip, it's more like oceans<br/><br/>
            They can't fit me in a Trojan<br/><br/>
            Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag<br/><br/>
            Yeah, that's the slogan<br/><br/>
            This that, "Who's all there?"<br/><br/>
            I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken<br/><br/>
            
            [Pre-Chorus]<br/>
            This that college dropout music<br/><br/>
            Every day leg day, she be too thick<br/><br/>
            And my friends are all annoying<br/><br/>
            But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid<br/><br/>

            Fuck you, and you, and you<br/><br/>
            I hate your friends and they hate me too<br/><br/>
            I'm through, I'm through, I'm through<br/><br/>
            This that hot girl bummer anthem<br/><br/>
            Turn it up and throw a tantrum<br/><br/>

            And you want me to change? Fuck you!<br/><br/>
